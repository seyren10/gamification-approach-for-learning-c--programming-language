  - 'Variables are containers for storing data values.

    

    In C#, there
    are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

    

    <#538C51>int</color>
    - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123

    <#538C51>double</color>
    - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99

    <#538C51>char</color>
    - stores single characters, such as ''a'' or ''B''. Char values are surrounded
    by single quotes

    <#538C51>string</color> - stores text, such as "Hello
    World". String values are surrounded by double quotes

    <#538C51>bool</color>
    - stores values with two states: true or false'
  - '<size=45>Declaring (Creating) Variables</size>

    To create a variable, you
    must specify the type and assign it a value:


    <i>type variableName = value;</i>


    Where
    type is a C# type (such as int or string), and variableName is the name of the
    variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the
    variable.'
